# Compiler Construction Projects

This repository collects all the projects of the Compiler Construction class. The codes are all based on [HACS](https://github.com/crsx/hacs). The overall goal of the projects is to build a compiler from MiniC to ARM32 machine code. MiniC is inspired by C, especially the pointer manipulation subset. ARM32 is a computer architecture commonly used in lower-end devices such as cell phones.
